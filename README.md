About 4% of people all over the world have different kinds of disability. About 190 millions of people can not feel their hands and feet and they are not able to do a simplest operations. 

Nowerdays, for sure, the very important point for everybody of us is to have the access to the internet and possibility to browse the web.

We are always saying "Let's make the web better", having in minds design, usability, new features and etc. What we would like to do with our idea and prototype is to make the web accessible (as easier as possible) for people with complete or partial paralysis of the body.

## The idea
-----------
First prototype that we made for #hack4good hackaton allows people with paralysis of the arms and legs to browse the web using head movements and voice-clicks.

## How does this work?
-----------
We'll use only the webcam that exists in every laptop and newest web technologies to move cursor on the page following face movements. Click will be performed with voice command.

## Why does this innovation is so amazing, helpful and cool?
-----------
All current scope of technics to help people with such kind of disabilities cost a huge amount of money and require additional devices and equipment, so only small group of people can really use this stuff. 

Instead of this we are trying to do it only using camera and microphone that people already have in any laptop. 

Finally this technology will be avaliable in Chrome browser as extension, that can be installed for free in 2 clicks. Directly after installation, it will automaticly work on every web page you want to browse.

The first concept that we did based on unique combination of algoritms to follow the face movements and voice detection. We use only open source techniques and libraries. It already works quite well, and we spend only 2 days to make the first prototype working.

## What's the next steps:
-----------
* make the code review (now it looks really hacky)
* improve follow face movements algoritms using short timeframe analysis,  webShaders, contrast and light auto abjustments
* improve sound detection based on everage levels of noise in timeframe, correlation analysis, convolution based filters.
* "Swipe" actions for esier navigation
* virtual keyboard with smart navigation and input text possibilities.
* Adaptive algoritm that can learn personal factors (Automaic adaptation to partiqular face, voice, camera, microphone)
* Try to implement different work modes for different kinds of disability (Detection of eyes, apple of the eyes, tang, eyebrows)

## Why it is important to finish
-----------
We hope it will make a web avaliable for people with different kinds disabilities in every place on the planet. It will help them to live and grow socially, share thair position and feelings, give them a way to get a new emotions from everyday life.

that is a very huge inspiration
