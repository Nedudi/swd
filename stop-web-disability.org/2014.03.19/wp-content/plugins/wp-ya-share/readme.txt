Adds the Yandex 'Share in social networks' block into posts or widget to simplify saving URLs of your blog pages into social networks.

== Description ==

The WP Ya.Share plugin adds to your blog a set of buttons to save URLs of your pages/posts in popular social networks (twitter, facebook, livejournal, vkontakte etc.).

Добавляет блок 'Поделиться' (Ya.Share, разработанный в yandex) для сохранения ссылки просматриваемой страницы вашего блога в популярных 'социальных сервисах' (вконтакте, жж, твиттер и т. д.).

It uses the Yandex Ya.share API; I shaped it into wordpress plugin with some options only.

The following options are available:

* locate "ya.share" block either in the content of a page/single post or in the sidebar (as a new widget);
* select a list of preferable social networks;
* button/link/icon for expanded social networks list, or nothing;
* left, right or centered location;
* above or under the content;
* inscription language.

== Installation ==

1. Upload wp-ya-share.zip to your plugins directory using the wordpress plugin installation interface and activate the plugin.
2. Select your preferable options at the Ya.share options page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I need Ya.share appears everywhere in my blog, not on pages and single posts =

On the plugin options page select 'create widget', then set the Ya.share widget to the appropriate place in a sidebar.

Or select 'multiple' (also in any post on archive pages) option.

= I would like to embed ya share into some posts, not into all. =

Check the Ya.share location option: "selectively". Then just add this code: [ya_share] into the post content.
