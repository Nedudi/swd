= Get Much More Powerful Form Protection from Simple Comments =

Spam Free Wordpress is a free plugin that can help block automated comment spam. The protection is great for some small blogs, but other blogs that are targeted by spammers need something more powerful.

[Simple Comments](http://www.toddlahman.com/shop/simple-comments/) was created to provide powerful spambot and hackbot protection for nearly all the forms on a blog, including the comment form. The protection is so powerful we've never had a customer complain that spam made it past Simple Comments, and yet no legitamate comments are ever blocked (no false positives), like you get from competing services like Akismet.

Spam can damage a blog's Search Engine Optimization (SEO) reputation, and credibility with customers and readers, so it is crtical to be sure spam never appears anywhere on your blog, especially if you are selling products, or care about your reputation.

Simple Comments doesn't just protect against automated spambots, it also protects against automated hackbots. The consequences of a hacked blog range from your blog sending out messages to everyone who has an account, to negative posts and comments that appear to be from you, and can even cause your entire blog and database to be deleted. Simple Comment uses unique and innovative technology that is constantly improving to protect your blog.
