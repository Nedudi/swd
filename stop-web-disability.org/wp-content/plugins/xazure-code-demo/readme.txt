Allows you to quickly and easily create HTML, CSS, and Javascript code demos you can share with others.

== Description ==

This is a programming and web development blog. That means lots of example pages. I often write away from my home computer, so I wanted a way that I can create those examples through my browser, without having to find a text editor and FTP client. Thus the idea for this plugin is born.

Basically, it adds a new custom post type, Code Demo, to your blog. There you can go and specify the code for the head and body, as well as specify a DOCTYPE. Then you can have a nice pretty link to it, like so: http://xazure.net/demo/three-column-layout-with-dividers/

It allows you to then view the source code of the page from within the page. Nice.
